**Project: VAPI Secure Intake Dashboard (Demo Build)**

* * * * *

**ROLE & CONTEXT**
------------------

You are a **senior full-stack engineer** working inside Replit Build Mode.

Your task is to build a **high-fidelity demo application** (not production) that visually and conceptually represents a **secure AI voice + SMS intake system** powered by Vapi, Supabase, and automation tooling.

This demo will be used in a **sales Loom** to close a client.

The goal is **clarity, trust, and inevitability**, not full functionality.

* * * * *

**CORE OBJECTIVE**
------------------

Build a **single web app** that demonstrates:

1.  How AI calls/texts become **structured records**

2.  How the **same data** is shown differently to:

    -   Super Admin

    -   Client User

3.  How the system acts as a **secure system of record**

4.  How cost, routing, and access are controlled

The app must *feel* real, polished, and enterprise-ready --- even if the backend is lightweight.

* * * * *

**NON-GOALS (IMPORTANT)**
-------------------------

This is **not** a production system.

Do **not** attempt:

-   Full authentication (mock roles instead)

-   Full Vapi prompt engineering

-   n8n / email sending

-   Real Supabase setup

-   Real billing logic

-   Multilingual optimization

We are building a **demo with real structure**, not a real deployment.

* * * * *

**TECH CONSTRAINTS**
--------------------

-   Must run fully inside Replit

-   Must be demo-ready in under 1 hour of build time

-   Backend can use:

    -   In-memory store, SQLite, or lightweight local DB

-   Frontend should be fast, clean, and minimal

* * * * *

**TECH STACK (Preferred)**
--------------------------

-   **Frontend:** React (or Next.js if faster in Replit)

-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS

-   **Backend:** Node.js (Express or Next API routes)

-   **State:** Simple server state (array / local DB)

-   **No external auth services**

* * * * *

**APP STRUCTURE (HIGH LEVEL)**
------------------------------

### **Pages / Routes**

1.  /

    -   Landing / Login Selector

    -   Buttons:

        -   "Login as Super Admin"

        -   "Login as Client"

2.  /dashboard

    -   Renders different UI based on role

    -   Same underlying data

    -   Different visibility and controls

3.  /webhook/vapi (API route)

    -   Receives simulated or real Vapi webhook payload

    -   Inserts a new "conversation record" into datastore

* * * * *

**DATA MODEL (SIMPLIFIED)**
---------------------------

Each record should include:

-   id

-   name

-   phone

-   address

-   intent

-   department

-   channel (Voice / SMS)

-   language

-   duration_seconds

-   cost

-   timestamp

-   transcript_summary (string)

Seed the app with **5--8 fake records**.

* * * * *

**ROLE-BASED UI REQUIREMENTS**
------------------------------

### **CLIENT DASHBOARD**

Client can:

-   View table of their records

-   Filter by department

-   Download CSV (fake but functional)

-   See:

    -   Name

    -   Address

    -   Intent

    -   Department

    -   Channel

    -   Timestamp

-   Button:

    -   "Send Broadcast SMS" (opens modal, no real send)

Client CANNOT:

-   See other clients

-   See markup or cost breakdown

-   Access records by URL ID

* * * * *

### **SUPER ADMIN DASHBOARD**

Super Admin sees **everything**, plus:

-   Cost per record

-   Total minutes today

-   Cost vs markup

-   Client selector (fake)

-   Ability to set:

    -   Cost markup percentage (UI only)

This view should clearly feel like **platform-level control**.

* * * * *

**VAPI WEBHOOK DEMO (OPTIONAL BUT DESIRED)**
--------------------------------------------

If possible:

-   Expose POST /webhook/vapi

-   Accept JSON payload

-   On receipt:

    -   Create a new record

    -   Auto-assign:

        -   intent = "Pothole"

        -   department = "Public Works"

-   Refresh dashboard to show new row

This enables a Loom moment where a **real call triggers visible data**.

If webhook integration becomes unstable:

-   Fall back gracefully to seeded data

-   Do NOT block the build

* * * * *

**DESIGN & UX DIRECTION (VERY IMPORTANT)**
------------------------------------------

The UI should feel:

-   **Minimal**

-   **Modern**

-   **Liquid-glass / Apple-like**

-   Calm, neutral, trustworthy

### **Design principles:**

-   White / light gray background

-   Soft borders

-   Rounded corners

-   Subtle shadows

-   No clutter

-   Tables with lots of breathing room

-   Clean typography

-   No heavy colors

-   No dashboards that feel "SaaS spammy"

This app should look like something:

> "A municipality or healthcare org would trust."

* * * * *

**UX DETAILS TO INCLUDE**
-------------------------

-   Clear role indicator (Client vs Super Admin)

-   Clear separation of permissions

-   Empty states handled gracefully

-   Loading states (even if fake)

-   No exposed IDs in URLs

-   No debug junk in UI

* * * * *

**NARRATIVE AWARENESS (IMPORTANT)**
-----------------------------------

This app will be shown in a Loom with narration like:

> "This is the system of record fed by Vapi voice and SMS agents."

So structure the UI to **support that story**:

-   Tables feel authoritative

-   Data feels final

-   No toy-like visuals

* * * * *

**DELIVERY EXPECTATION**
------------------------

By the end of this build, I should be able to:

-   Open the app

-   Click "Login as Client"

-   See clean reports

-   Switch to "Super Admin"

-   See expanded controls

-   (Optionally) trigger a webhook and watch data appear

* * * * *

**FINAL INSTRUCTION**
---------------------

Prioritize:

1.  UX clarity

2.  Visual polish

3.  Conceptual correctness

Over:

-   Edge cases

-   Full integrations

-   Over-engineering

Build decisively.

If tradeoffs are required, **favor UI over backend complexity**.
