Before making any changes, I want to understand what already exists in this project so I can decide whether to reuse it for a production Phase 1 build.

Please answer the following clearly and specifically.

⸻

1️⃣ Architecture & Stack
	1.	What framework is this app built with (e.g. Next.js, Vite + React, plain React, etc.)?
	2.	Is there a backend/API layer, or is everything client-side?
	3.	Where does server-side logic live (API routes, Express server, etc.)?
	4.	Is the project structured in a way that supports adding real integrations later (Supabase, webhooks, auth)?

⸻

2️⃣ Data Model & State
	5.	What is the current data model used for the dashboard?
	6.	Are “interactions” represented as a single object type? If so, what fields exist?
	7.	Is the data hardcoded, mocked, or coming from an API?
	8.	Is there a clear place where ingestion from Vapi/Twilio could be wired in?
	9.	Are client vs super-admin views derived from the same underlying data?

⸻

3️⃣ Role & Access Separation
	10.	How are roles currently handled (hardcoded toggle, state variable, routing, etc.)?
	11.	Is the UI already structured to cleanly separate:
	•	client view
	•	super admin view
	12.	Would it be straightforward to replace the role toggle with real auth later?

⸻

4️⃣ Dashboard Functionality
	13.	What dashboard features are already implemented?
	•	tables
	•	filters
	•	CSV export
	•	cost / duration columns
	14.	Which features are purely visual vs actually functional?
	15.	Are any parts of the UI tightly coupled to fake data assumptions?

⸻

5️⃣ Reuse & Migration Risk
	16.	What parts of this codebase are clearly demo-only and would need to be rewritten?
	17.	What parts look production-viable with minimal changes?
	18.	Are there any architectural decisions that would block:
	•	scaling to hundreds of records per day
	•	adding auth / RLS
	•	adding async ingestion

⸻

6️⃣ Recommendation (Critical)
	19.	In your opinion, should this codebase be:
	•	(A) Used as the foundation for Phase 1
	•	(B) Partially reused (UI only)
	•	(C) Treated as a throwaway demo
	20.	If partial reuse is recommended, which exact folders/files should be kept?
